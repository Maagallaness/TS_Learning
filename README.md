# TS_Learning_RMP

JavaScript is the most widely-used programming language for web development. But it lacks type-checking support, which is an essential feature of modern programming languages.

JavaScript was originally designed as a simple scripting language. Its loose nature and absence of crucial Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features pose certain challenges for developers:

Limited documentation and auto-completion.

Inability to utilise OOP concepts.

Lack of type safety, leading to runtime errors.

Challenges in refactoring and maintenance.

Absence of interfaces and integration points.

TypeScript solves these problems. It was built to make JavaScript a more perfect modern programming language. It helps improve the developer experience, offers many useful features, and improves interoperability.

This article dives into TypeScript basics. I’ll teach you how to install TS and set up a project. Then we’ll cover some important fundamentals. You’ll also learn how TypeScript compiles into JavaScript, making it compatible with browsers and Node.js environments.

# What we’ll cover
# Prerequisites
Before diving into TypeScript, it's important to have a foundational understanding of certain concepts to ensure a smoother learning journey. While TypeScript enhances JavaScript with static typing and other powerful features, it builds on core JavaScript principles. Here's what you should know:

1. JavaScript Fundamentals
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it extends JavaScript's capabilities. To effectively learn TypeScript, you should first have a solid grasp of JavaScript basics, including:

Syntax and data types: Understand how to declare variables (let, const, and var), work with primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans), and manage arrays and objects.

Control flow: Be familiar with loops (for, while), conditionals (if-else, switch), and how they control program execution.

Functions: Know how to define and invoke functions, work with parameters, return values, and understand concepts like arrow functions and closures.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Learn about creating and working with objects, classes, and inheritance. TypeScript's class-based features build heavily on JavaScript's OOP model.

Error handling: Understand how to use try-catch blocks to handle runtime errors.

2. Basic HTML and CSS
Although TypeScript is a language used primarily with JavaScript, having a basic understanding of HTML and CSS is helpful, especially for front-end developers. This is because most TypeScript projects involve creating or working with web applications

HTML: Understand how to structure web pages using tags, attributes, and elements.

CSS: Learn how to style elements using selectors, properties, and values. Familiarity with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap is a bonus.

3. Familiarity with Development Tools
A code editor like Visual Studio Code, which has excellent TypeScript support and extensions.

Node.js and npm: Understand how to set up a development environment, run JavaScript outside the browser, and use npm (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies.

Version control (Git): Learn the basics of Git to track changes and collaborate effectively on TypeScript projects.
